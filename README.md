# Mentorship
My personlly made content for a self-taught programmer, coder, or computer science

This is just some content that will help bootstrap your overall
developing career. All the items in here are just links and websites that will
help start you down a path for more content to keep learning, exploring and
growing as a developer. I have done each of these tutorials, read each of these
books and I still re-read or re-do each of them from time to time.

### How to navigate
Each of these directories has one main topic, the shell, ruby, ruby on rails,
git, javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, etc. Each directory will have a README.md
that will contain links and maybe some exercises or walk throughs.

### My thoughts
My thoughts may differ from developer to developer but I feel what has made
myself succesful is the desire to learn and learn **A LOT** everything from `git` to `ruby on
rails`. Each of these topics is just as important as the other they all build
upon each other. So really, don't skip (too much) unless you feel like you really
have the topic down. Some topics or programing concepts are harder than others.
So really don't worry it is frustrating, we have all been there
and still get frustrated (I know I do). However, it takes time and it is the 'process'.
Each person has there way of learning. For me, I **have** to write my own code and
do the exercises to be comfortable with the topic and even I still have a
problem with learning a new topic (granted I'm still really new to the field).
The greatest advice I've heard is "just trust the process". It will come. It
will begin to make sense, and hey if it just clicks, it clicks and good for you,
pat your self on the back :).
