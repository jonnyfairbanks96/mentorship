# Mentorship
My personlly made content for a self-taught programmer, coder, or computer science

This is just some content that will help bootstrap your overall
developing career. All the items in here are just links and websites that will
help start you down a path for more content to keep learning, exploring and
growing as a developer. I have done each of these tutorials, read each of these
books and I still re-read or re-do each of them from time to time.

### How to navigate
Each of these directories has one main topic, the shell, ruby, ruby on rails,
git, javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, etc. Each directory will have a README.md
that will contain links, and maybe some exercises or walk throughs.
Each of these topics is just as important as the other, they all build
_with_ each other (they are tools to get your job done). So I wouldn't skip
(too much) unless you feel like you really have the topic down.
