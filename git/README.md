# Git
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git):
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in
source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work
among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its
goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed,
non-linear workflows.

Git it absolutely essential to any developer. I know I say this about all of
the topics but this esspecially. Git is a version control system that each
developer must use and get comfortable with. Git is sometimes confusing and can
be hard to completely understand but it will make you a better developer once
you _git_ the hang of it.

In my day to day life, Git is primally used to create "branches" to develop code
that I can then merge into the base branch which then moves to production or
your webite that is released to the public.

I recomend these sites for learning Git.

- [Learn Enough](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial/getting_started)
- [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/books/git) This includes github which you are reading this on right now
- [Git collaboration](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing)
- [Git Cheatsheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet)

When starting out, try to use git as much as possible. Push everything to
[Github](https://github.com), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/). This will be the best way to learn
Git.
