# CSS
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets):
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a
cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript

CSS is another one of those foundational languages that is vital for web
development. It is how your website is shown and displayed for the whole world
to see. If you care about making things look pretty and/or cool, then CSS is
going to be fun for you.
