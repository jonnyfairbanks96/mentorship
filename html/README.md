# HTML
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML):
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating
web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide
Web.

HTML is the foundation of the Internet and any webpage you see. Any web page you
see is built with some sort of HTML or a language that compiles to HTML here is
a brief
[list](https://github.com/coffee-js/languages/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-HTML-CSS).
You dont need to know any of those languages FYI.

I recomend these sites for learning HTML.

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) (might be a little outdated not
sure)
