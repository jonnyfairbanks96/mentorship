# JavaScript
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript):
JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
object-orientation, and first-class functions.

JavaScript is everywhere. From the client side (your web browser), to the
server. It is most notably used for creating dynamic webpages that move around,
creating cool animations (paired with CSS), manipulating you DOM, and [single page
applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn463786.aspx).
