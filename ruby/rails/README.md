# Ruby on Rails
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails):
Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in
Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework,
providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It
encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data
transfer, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. In addition to MVC,
Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and
paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself
(DRY), and the active record pattern.

Rails is a full-stack framework. It allows you to have a database, move data
through views, upload files to your database, etc. With Rails you can build
sites like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and any other major social media site
all the way to a simple
[API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) that talks
to other applications (with no browser interface).
