# Ruby Gems
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems):
RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a
standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a
self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the
installation of gems, and a server for distributing them. It was created by Chad
Fowler and Richard Kilmer during RubyConf 2004.

Ruby Gems are highly used in the Ruby Commnunity, they are a way for developers
to easily setup user authentication, design API's, do complex math, etc. There
is often a gem for everything you may do but take this with a grain of salt. The
more gems you have in you application the more dependencies you have.
