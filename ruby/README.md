# Ruby
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)):
Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was
designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

Ruby is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming
paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada,
and Lisp.

Simply put ruby is a server side programing language with a clear and easy to
read syntax. Ruby is what I have done my day to day work with for the past year.
I personally think ruby is really awesome and their are many advantages to using
ruby for any of your projects. You will often hear ruby associated with
[rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) which is just a framework for web applications
with ruby.
