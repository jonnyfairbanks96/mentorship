## Shell
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU
Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in
1989, it has been distributed widely as the default login shell for most Linux
distributions and Apple's macOS (formerly OS X). A version is also available for
Windows 10. It is also the default user shell in Solaris 11.

The Shell, BASH, command line, or any other Unix Shell is an everyday tool you must know and
get to know well. In any tutorial you may have already seen this little screen
to start a server, open a file, use git (version control) or simple just to say
'Hello World' to your self. (`echo 'Hello World`). However, it is so much more than that.
I do all of my day to day work in the shell and I find it is
the most useful tool I have learned and come to love since starting to code. It can be complex and hard
to get the hang of but once you understand the basics you will love working in
this black and white screen.

I recomend these sites for learning the command line.
